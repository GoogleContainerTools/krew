# Plugin Naming Style Guide

This document explain the best practices and recommendations for naming kubectl
plugins. These guidelines are used for reviewing the plugins submitted to 
[krew-index](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/krew-index) repository.

#### _Punctuation_

Plugin names must be all lowercase and separate words with hyphens**Don't **use
camelCase, PascalCase, or snake_case; use
[kebab-case](http://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase).

- **DON'T:** `kubectl plugin OpenSvc`<br/>
  **DO:** `kubectl plugin `open-svc`

#### _Be specific_

Plugin names should not be verbs/nouns that are generic, already overloaded, or
possibly can be used for broader purposes by another plugin.

- **DON'T:** `kubectl plugin login`: Tries to put dibs on the word.<br/>
  **DO:** `kubectl plugin gke-login`.

- **DON'T:** `kubectl plugin ui`: Should be used only for Kubernetes
  Dashboard.<br/>
  **DO:** `kubectl plugin gke-ui`.

#### _Be unique_

Try to find a unique name for your plugin that differentiates you from other
possible plugins doing the same job.

- **DON'T:** `kubectl plugin logs`: Unclear how it is different than the builtin
  "logs" command, or many other tools for viewing logs.<br/>
  **DO:** `kubectl plugin multilogs`:  Unique name, points to the underlying
  tool name.

#### _Use Verbs/Resource Types_

If the name does not make it clear (a) what verb the plugin is doing on a
resource, or (b) what kind of resource it's doing the action on, consider
clarifying unless it is obvious.

- **DON'T:** `kubectl plugin service`: Unclear what this plugin is doing with
  service.<br/>
  **DON'T:** `kubectl plugin open`: Unclear what it is opening.<br/>
  **DO:** `kubectl plugin open-svc`: It is clear the plugin will open a service.

#### _Prefix Vendor Identifiers_

Use the vendor-specific strings as prefix, separated with a dash. This makes it
easier to search/group plugins that are about a specific vendor.

- **DON'T:** `kubectl plugin ui-gke`: Makes it harder to search or locate in a
  plugin list.<br/>
  **DO:** `kubectl plugin gke-ui`: Will show up next to other gke-* plugins.

#### _Avoid repeating kube[rnetes]_

Plugin names should not repeat kube- or kubernetes- prefixes to avoid
stuttering.

- **DON'T:** `kubectl plugin kube-node-admin`: "kubectl " already has "kube" in
  it.<br/>
  **DO:** `kubectl plugin node-admin`.

#### _Avoid Resource Acronyms_

Using kubectl acronyms for API resources (e.g. svc, ing, deploy, cm) reduces
readability and discoverability of a plugin more than it is saving keystrokes.

- **DON'T:** `kubectl plugin new-ing`: Hard to spot and the plugin is for
  Ingress.<br/>
  **DO:** `kubectl plugin debug-ingress`.

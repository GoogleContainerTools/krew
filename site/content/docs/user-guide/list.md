title: Listing Installed Plugins
slug: list

You can list all installed `kubectl` plugins (including those not installed via
Krew) using:

```sh
{{<prompt>}}kubectl plugin list
```

To list all plugins installed via Krew, run:

```sh
{{<prompt>}}kubectl krew list
```

### Backing up plugin list

When you pipe or redirect `kubectl krew list` commandâ€™s output to another file
or command, it will return a list of plugin names installed, e.g.:

```sh
{{<prompt>}}kubectl krew list | tee backup.txt
access-matrix
whoami
tree
```

You can then [install]({{<ref "install.md">}}) the list of plugins from a file
by feeding the file to the `install` command over standard input (stdin):

```sh
{{<prompt>}}kubectl krew install < backup.txt
```
